## üìñ Overview
With the rapid growth of mobile devices, SMS phishing (Smishing) and mobile malware attacks have become significant cyber threats. This project explores how attackers use Smishing techniques to deliver malicious payloads and what the implications are for mobile security.

### üéØ Objective

The goal of this project is to:

- Simulate SMS phishing attacks using Dagah to understand how attackers target mobile devices.
- Demonstrate the setup and execution of phishing attacks on Android Virtual Devices (AVD) to mimic real-world scenarios.
- Observe and analyze how phishing messages are delivered and received on mobile devices.
- Discuss the broader impact of SMS phishing attacks in real-world contexts.
- Develop recommendations for detecting and mitigating SMS phishing attacks.

## üîç **1. Simulation of SMS Phishing Attack (Smishing)**


### Step 1: Setting Up the Attack Environment
To simulate phishing attacks, I used Dagah, a tool designed for penetration testing and phishing simulation. The attack targeted an Android Virtual Device (AVD), simulating how real-world malware delivers malicious payloads through phishing links.

### Step 2: Configuring the Modem and Attacker Device
The next step was configuring the modem on the attacker's side and linking it to the virtual Android device. This allows the attacker to send the phishing SMS to the target.

### Step 3: Setting Up the Android Virtual Devices (AVD)
For this simulation, I used Android Studio to set up the AVDs. These virtual devices acted as the attacker and victim devices, helping simulate how the phishing attack is delivered and interacted with by the target.

### Step 4: Sending the Phishing SMS
Once the modem was configured, I crafted and executed the phishing SMS attack, sending a malicious link disguised as a legitimate message to the target's Android device.

### Step 5: Observing the SMS on the Target Device
After sending the phishing SMS, I observed the message being received on the target Android Virtual Device. This simulation mimicked how a real user might interact with the malicious link.

## üîë Findings and Insights
The simulation of the phishing attack revealed key insights into how attackers can use SMS phishing to trick users into interacting with malicious links. Here are the key findings from the project:

- **Social Engineering**: The phishing attack relied on social engineering to convince the victim to click on the malicious link.
- **Phishing Link**: The message contained a URL that, if clicked, would lead to a fake login page that mimics legitimate services.
- **Target Interaction**: By observing the target Android Virtual Device, it became clear how easy it is for unsuspecting users to fall for such tricks, especially if the message is crafted convincingly.

## üõ°Ô∏è Recommendations

Based on the results of this project, the following recommendations can be made to help prevent SMS phishing (Smishing) attacks:

1. **User Awareness and Education**: Users need to be educated about the dangers of interacting with suspicious SMS messages, especially those that ask them to click on links from unknown senders.
2. **Mobile Security Solutions**: Encourage the use of mobile security solutions that can scan for malicious links in SMS messages.
3. **Mobile Device Management (MDM)**: Enterprises should implement MDM systems to monitor mobile device activity and block malicious links.
4. **Regular Software Updates**: Keeping Android devices updated with the latest security patches can mitigate vulnerabilities.
5. **Incident Response**: Businesses should develop incident response plans to isolate compromised devices and notify affected users in case of a phishing attack.

## üèÅ Conclusion

This project demonstrated how SMS phishing attacks (Smishing) work, using tools like Dagah and Android Virtual Devices (AVD) to simulate real-world scenarios. By exploring these attacks and analyzing their implications, we can better protect users from phishing attempts in the future
