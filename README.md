# üì± **Exploring SMS Phishing and Mobile Malware**

**A comprehensive case study and analysis of SMS phishing attacks (Smishing) and mobile malware targeting Android devices. This project involves simulation of attacks, mobile device analysis, and network traffic inspection using tools like Dagah, Android Virtual Devices (AVD), and Wireshark.**

## üìñ **Overview**

With the rapid growth of mobile devices, **SMS phishing (Smishing)** and **mobile malware** attacks have become significant cyber threats. This project explores how attackers use Smishing techniques to deliver malicious payloads (such as **FluBot** and **TangleBot**) via SMS.

Using **Dagah** for attack simulations and **Android Virtual Devices (AVD)** for mobile analysis, this project demonstrates how these attacks work and the potential security implications. **Wireshark** is also employed for network traffic analysis to detect malicious activities.

## üéØ **Objective**

The goal of this project is to:
- **Simulate SMS phishing attacks** using **Dagah** and understand how attackers target mobile devices.
- **Analyse the behavior of mobile malware** delivered through phishing.
- **Investigate network traffic** to capture communication between the infected device and malware servers.
- **Develop recommendations** for detecting and mitigating SMS phishing and mobile malware threats.

## üîç **1. Simulation of SMS Phishing Attack (Smishing)**

This section covers the steps involved in simulating an SMS phishing attack using **Dagah**.

### **Step 1: Setting Up the Attack Environment**
To simulate phishing attacks, I used **Dagah**, a tool designed for penetration testing and phishing simulation. The attack targeted an **Android Virtual Device (AVD)**, simulating how real-world malware like **FluBot** and **TangleBot** deliver malicious payloads through phishing links.

### **Step 2: Crafting the Phishing Message**
I crafted a phishing SMS containing a malicious URL disguised as a legitimate link. This link redirected users to a fake login page that mimicked popular mobile services, demonstrating how attackers steal sensitive information.

### **Step 3: Observing the Attack on the Android Virtual Device (AVD)**
Once the phishing SMS was sent, I used an **Android Virtual Device (AVD)** to simulate the user interaction and observe the malware's behavior on an Android system. This helped me understand the impact of the attack on a mobile device.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **2. Dynamic Analysis of Mobile Malware**

After the phishing attack was successfully delivered, I conducted a **dynamic analysis** of the malware's behavior on the Android Virtual Device (AVD).

### **Step 1: Monitoring Malware Behavior**
Upon clicking the phishing link, the Android Virtual Device was infected with a sample mobile malware that mimicked the behavior of **FluBot** and **TangleBot**. I observed how the malware:
- **Accessed sensitive information.**
- **Monitored incoming messages.**
- **Tried to propagate to other contacts via additional phishing SMS.**

### **Step 2: Capturing Network Traffic Using Wireshark**
Using **Wireshark**, I captured the network traffic generated by the malware during the attack. This included communication with **command-and-control servers**, revealing how the malware exfiltrates data and retrieves further instructions from remote servers.

## üîë **Findings and Insights**

This analysis revealed key insights into how mobile malware like **FluBot** and **TangleBot** operate via SMS phishing:
- **FluBot**: Spreads via SMS messages with malicious links that direct users to install malware disguised as a legitimate application. Once installed, it steals personal information, including banking credentials and contacts.
- **TangleBot**: Targets users through fake system updates, gaining control over the infected device‚Äôs data, SMS messages, and multimedia files.

### **Key Findings**:
- **Social Engineering**: The attack relies on social engineering, convincing users to trust the phishing link and download malware.
- **Network Communication**: The malware actively communicates with external servers, sending back stolen data and receiving new instructions.
- **Evasion Techniques**: **FluBot** and **TangleBot** use **obfuscation** and **dynamic URLs** to avoid detection and blacklist monitoring.

## üõ°Ô∏è **Recommendations**

To mitigate the risks of SMS phishing and mobile malware, I propose the following strategies:
1. **User Education**: Raising awareness about the dangers of clicking on links in unsolicited SMS messages is key to preventing these attacks.
2. **Mobile Security Software**: Encourage users to install trusted mobile security apps that can detect and block malware installations.
3. **Network Traffic Monitoring**: Enterprises should monitor network traffic for signs of malware activity, such as connections to known malicious IP addresses.
4. **Patch Management**: Ensure that mobile operating systems and applications are up-to-date with the latest security patches to mitigate vulnerabilities.

## üèÅ **Conclusion**

This project highlights the increasing threat posed by **SMS phishing** and **mobile malware**. By simulating attacks and analysing the behavior of malware on Android devices, I was able to gain valuable insights into how these threats operate and how they can be mitigated. The techniques demonstrated in this project can be applied to real-world scenarios, improving mobile security practices and protecting users from similar threats.
